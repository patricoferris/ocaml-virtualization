ocaml-virtualization
--------------------

Bindings to Apple's virtualization framework (WIP & Experimental)

Also included is a CLI tool for running VMs on macOS. Note this requires macOS 11+ (Big Sur and up). Eventually (hopefully)
the macOS boot loader will be supported which is 12+ (Monterey and up).
